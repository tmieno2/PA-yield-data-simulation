Title: Generate synthetic data immitating on-farm precision experiments
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Taro Mieno
Maintainer: Taro Mieno <tmieno2@unl.edu>
Description: This package generates synthetic data immitating on-farm precision 
    experiments. The primary goal of the data is to check the performance of
    statistical methods to recover heterogenenous yield response to an input.
    This pacakge is designed only for reproducing data that were used in
    published articles that use this package to generate data. Therefore, it 
    lacks flexibility in many respects including the functional form of yield 
    response to an input (only quadratic-plateau is available), variables created.
